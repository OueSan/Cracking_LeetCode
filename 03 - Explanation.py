Let's understand step by step:
Input: You are given a 2D list called student_data. Each sublist within it contains two elements: the first is the student's ID, and the second is their age. For example:

student_data = [
  [1, 15],
  [2, 11],
  [3, 11],
  [4, 20]
]
Goal: The task is to transform this 2D list into a DataFrame with two columns: student_id and age. The student_id column will contain the student IDs, and the age column will contain the respective ages.

Output: The result should be a DataFrame that looks like this:


+------------+-----+
| student_id | age |
+------------+-----+
| 1          | 15  |
| 2          | 11  |
| 3          | 11  |
| 4          | 20  |
+------------+-----+

How to solve:
You can use the Python pandas library to create the DataFrame. Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis.

Here’s a possible solution in Python:


import pandas as pd
from typing import List

def create_dataframe(student_data):
    # Create a DataFrame from the 2D list, with columns 'student_id' and 'age'
    df = pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=['student_id', 'age'])
    return df

#01
Detailed Explanation: Imports:
import pandas as pd: This imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation in Python.
#PS: in real python code you have to add this library, instead you gonna get one "NameError: name 'List' is not defined. Did you mean: 'list'?"
from typing import List: This allows you to use the List type to indicate that the input student_data will be a list of lists of integers.

#02
Defining the Function:
The function createDataframe takes a parameter student_data, which is a list of lists of integers (each sublist represents the student’s ID and age).

#03
Creating the DataFrame:
pd.DataFrame(student_data, columns=['student_id', 'age']): This line creates a DataFrame from the 2D list student_data. The columns of the DataFrame are named student_id and age.

#04
Returning the DataFrame:
return df: #This line returns the created DataFrame.


#How the function works: When you pass the student_data list to the createDataframe function, it will generate and return a DataFrame that has the student_id and age columns, exactly in the order of the provided data.
