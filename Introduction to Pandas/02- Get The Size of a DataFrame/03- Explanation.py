Problem Explanation:
You have a DataFrame called players with columns like player_id, name, age, position, etc. You need to write a function that returns the number of rows and columns in this DataFrame as a list. The format of the output should be [number of rows, number of columns].

Example:
Given a DataFrame with the following data:

player_id	name	age	position	team
846	Mason	21	Forward	RealMadrid
749	Riley	30	Winger	Barcelona
155	Bob	28	Striker	ManchesterUnited
583	Isabella	32	Goalkeeper	Liverpool
388	Zachary	24	Midfielder	BayernMunich
883	Ava	23	Defender	Chelsea
355	Violet	18	Striker	Juventus
247	Thomas	27	Striker	ParisSaint-Germain
761	Jack	33	Midfielder	ManchesterCity
642	Charlie	36	Center-back	Arsenal
The function should return [10, 5] because there are 10 rows and 5 columns in the DataFrame.

How the Code Works:
players.shape: This method returns a tuple containing two elements: the first is the number of rows, and the second is the number of columns in the DataFrame. For example, if the DataFrame has 10 rows and 5 columns, players.shape will return (10, 5).

list(players.shape): Converts the tuple returned by shape into a list. This is because the function is expected to return a list, such as [10, 5].
