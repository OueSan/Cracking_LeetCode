Problem Understanding:
You have a DataFrame students with columns student_id, name, and age, where some rows have missing (or None) values in the name column. The task is to remove these rows that have missing values in the name column.

Steps of the Solution:
Importing pandas: The pandas library is necessary for working with DataFrames, so we import it at the start.


import pandas as pd
Defining the Function: We define a function dropMissingData that takes a pandas DataFrame as input and returns a modified DataFrame with rows that have missing name values removed.


def dropMissingData(students: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
Dropping Rows with Missing Values: The key part of this function is using dropna(), a pandas method that removes rows containing missing values in the specified column. Here, we specifically look for missing values in the name column using the subset parameter:

result = students.dropna(subset=['name'])
dropna() removes rows where name is missing (i.e., it has None or NaN values).
subset=['name'] tells the function to check only the name column for missing values.
Returning the Result: After dropping the rows with missing name values, we return the resulting DataFrame.


return result
Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input DataFrame:


   student_id     name  age
0          32    Piper    5
1         217     None   19
2         779  Georgia   20
3         849   Willow   14
The row with student_id 217 has a missing value in the name column (None). The dropna() function will remove that row, resulting in:


   student_id     name  age
0          32    Piper    5
2         779  Georgia   20
3         849   Willow   14
Output:
This is the final DataFrame after removing rows with missing name values.
