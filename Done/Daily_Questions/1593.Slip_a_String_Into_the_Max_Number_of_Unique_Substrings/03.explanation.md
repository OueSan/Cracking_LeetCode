Overview
This code provides a solution to the problem of finding the maximum number of unique parts into which a string can be split. It uses a backtracking approach with an unordered_set to track substrings that have already been seen, ensuring that all splits are unique.

Function maxUniqueSplit
This is the main function that starts the unique splitting process. It creates a set (unordered_set) to track unique substrings and calls the helper function backtrack to begin exploring potential splits.

Function backtrack
The backtrack function performs most of the work:

Base Case: If start reaches the end of the string, it returns 0 because there are no more parts to split.

Loop to find substrings:

The loop iterates from start + 1 to the end of the string. For each position end, it generates a substring.
If this substring has not been seen before (i.e., it is unique so far), it is inserted into the seen set.
Then, the function recursively calls backtrack to explore splits starting from index end.
After exploring that split, the substring is removed from the set to allow other potential splits.
Return: The function always tries to maximize the number of unique splits. The maximum value is updated after each recursive call.

Time Complexity
The time complexity is hard to determine exactly, but in the worst case, the number of substring combinations can be exponential with respect to the length of the string due to the recursive nature and the number of possible splits.

Example
For the string s = "ababccc", the function splits the string into the unique parts ["a", "b", "ab", "c", "cc", "c"], resulting in 6 unique parts.

This solution leverages the flexibility of backtracking to explore all possible combinations of substrings while ensuring each split is unique. The recursive calls allow the function to backtrack and explore different ways to maximize the number of unique splits.
