Can you help me practice reading the code below for a job interview? I need a step-by-step explanation of how to read each part of the code naturally in English, as if I were explaining it to someone. Here's the solution code for the LeetCode problem. I want the explanation formatted in markdown-style section headers (e.g., ##) with code blocks labeled like Inicial_Pointers [], and I also want the full explanation saved into a .txt file so I can copy it all at once.
